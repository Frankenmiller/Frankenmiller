- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Frankenmiller, I was born in California, I studied mandarin chinese in mainland China and now I live in Africa. After putting significant percentage my net worth into BTC and ETH I sold my business in US to focus full-time studying and writing code, perhaps trying to figure out what in the world I bought!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python|SQL|Linux|Tableau|Ethereum,  HTML and CSS (obvioulsy) but also quite a bit of JavaScript too
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS, mostly by following along on YouTube builds. I think I learn better by actually doing something
- ðŸ’ž Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on almost anything. I spend too much time coding alone, so it'd be great to team up with others and learn better how ppl think
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... my WhatsApp here in Zambia is +26 0954692511 please feel super welcome to msg me as programmer, or you can msg me at dr.frankenmiller@gmail.com either way is fine, also take look my LinkedIn page at www.linkedin.com/in/frankenmiller and endorse some my skills please! looking forward to hearing from you

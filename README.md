- 👋 Hi, I’m @Frankenmiller, I was born in California, I studied mandarin chinese in mainland China and now I live in Africa. After putting significant percentage my net worth into BTC and ETH I sold my business in US to focus full-time studying and writing code, perhaps trying to figure out what in the world I bought!
- 👀 I’m interested in Python ReactJS and Ethereum, obvioulsy I can write HTML and CSS (which is suprisingly interesting all of a sudden...) also I have plans to learn Django and Redux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, mostly by following along on YouTube builds. I think I learn better by actually doing something
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything. I spend too much time coding alone, so it'd be great to team up with others and learn better how ppl think
- 📫 How to reach me ... my WhatsApp here in Zambia is +26 0954692511 please feel super welcome to msg me as programmer, or you can msg me at dr.frankenmiller@gmail.com either way is fine, looking forward to hearing from you

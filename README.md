- 👋 Hi, I’m @Frankenmiller, I was born in California, I studied mandarin chinese in mainland China and now I live in Africa. I traded my business in US for pile of BTC and ETH coins to focus full-time studying and writing code, perhaps trying to figure out what in the world I bought!
- 👀 I’m interested in Python | SQL | Linux | Tableau | Ethereum.
- 🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything. I spend too much time coding alone, so it'd be great to team up with others and learn better how ppl think
